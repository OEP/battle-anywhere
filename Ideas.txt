== MAIN IDEA ==
A procedurally generated RPG based off of Bluetooth device ID's or
any other type of uniquely identifying seed.

These seeds correspond to creatures which fight in turn-based battles. In the
case that the seed is representative of a Bluetooth MAC it corresponds to a
hero. If it's just a random number, it corresponds to a trash creature
that a hero might fight.

== CORE ATTRIBUTES & ABILITY SETS ==
All creatures have three basic attributes: Strong, Quick, and Smart. In the
world, all creature have a primary score in one of these three attributes.
Additionally, for each of these attributes there are a set of abilities
which attack against one of the other core attributes. We will outline
these ability types.

== OTHER ABILITY PERKS ==

* Strong increases the amount of Max HP per level a creature gains.
* Quick increases the frequency at which the creature can attack.
* Mind increases experience gained per battle.

== BATTLE SYSTEM ==
The battle system is turn-based. The player can make basic attacks, use
abilities, or items. Abilities are limited by a system similar to traditional
MP.

=== The Generalized Damage Formula ===
All attacks follow the following generalized damage formula:

DMG = MAX( (ATK - DEF) + SUM(DICE), 1 ) * (AMP / DMP)

Where:re
* ATK is the attacking ability
* DEF is the defending ability
* DICE is a sequence of dice rolls
* AMP is an amplifying factor
* DMP is a dampening  factor

=== The Ability Stack ===
Every odd-numbered level the creature will get a new primary ability. Abilities
are governed by the first six digits of the MAC address (company make). The type of
attribute it uses as its attack is governed by that as well. Its target
is determined by the latter part of the MAC address.

Every third level, a creature will get a "wildcard" ability according to
its secondary attribute. The target will be determined randomly (but procedurally).

=== The Status Effect Stack ===
Every even-numbered level, the player will get a new status-affecting
attribute added to their previous ability. The status effect is determined
by the latter part of the MAC address.

The below figure shows the progression of the ability, wildcard, and status
affecting stacks. This would be for a creature of level 6. The number inside
the stack represent which tier attack is inherited at that level.
